AudioDotTurn
============

If you’re tired of your audio files being a complete mess with poorly
formatted names and missing metadata this might be your solution.

Using audiodotturn you can quickly and easily organize your entire audio
library with just a few commands.

The project initially began due to a dumb mistake by myself where I
downloaded over 3000+ songs with yt-dlp with no proper formatting or
metadata included.

Installation
============

.. code:: sh

     pip install git+https://github.com/tairenfd/audiodotturn.git

or

.. code:: sh

     git clone https:github.com/tairenfd/audiodotturn.git
     pip install ./ 

or build from current release source 1. Download the tar.gz package from
the project’s GitHub release page or wherever it is hosted.

2. Extract the contents of the package to a directory of your choice
   using the following command:

.. code:: sh

      tar -xvzf audiodotturn-v0.2.5.tar.gz

3. Change into the extracted directory:

.. code:: sh

      cd audiodotturn-v0.2.5

4. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

.. code:: sh

      pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If you’re using a virtual environment, make sure it’s activated
before running this command.

5. Install AudioDotTurn by running the following command:

.. code:: sh

      pip install ./

Finally
-------

Verify that AudioDotTurn is installed correctly by running the following
command:

.. code:: sh

      audiodotturn --version

This should print the version number of AudioDotTurn.

That’s it! You should now be able to use AudioDotTurn by running the
``audiodotturn`` command in your terminal.

Dependencies
============

External libraries: - `rich <https://github.com/Textualize/rich>`__

Standard: - os - re - json - argparse - shutil

Usage
=====

AudioDotTurn has two main commands: ``create`` and ``view``.

The ``create`` command allows you to format and/or organize your files,
while the ``view`` command allows you to view information about your
existing data.

The ``set`` command can also be used to set default values. It will have
you confirm or deny any changes to ensure safety. Multiple values can be
changed at once.

Choosing a formatter
--------------------

The default formatter is now the ‘standard’ formatter which applies no
youtube_id data attribute but otherwise works the same. It will still
read formatted files with a youtube_id fine when creating a json, but
will not create new datasets with youtube_id’s - instead putting that
info if provided into the ‘misc’ category. This is the recommended
formatter for general use.

The ‘youtube’ formatter is primarily for files downloaded with yt-dlp
that still contain a suffix of [youtube_id].ext

You can set a default formatter in the config.json file, or set it
during runtime with ``-x [formatter]``

To view the currently set default formatter use
``audiodotturn --default settings`` - default formatter listed under
``program_defaults -> formatter``

You can view the available formatters with
``audiodotturn --defaults options`` - options will be under
``formatter``

Creating a dataset
------------------

To create a dataset, you first need to format your filenames. There are
three options for formatting filenames:

1. **Format a single file:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create --formatfile [filename]

This will format the filename using the default format.

If your file doesn’t follow this format, the tool will attempt to format
it as best it can. You can also specify a custom format using the
``--format`` option.

2. **Format all files in a directory:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create --formatdir [directory]

This will format all files in the specified directory using the default
format.

3. **Organize files into artist directories:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create --dirs [directory]

This will organize all files in the specified directory into artist
directories based on the artist names in the filenames.

After formatting your filenames, you can create a dataset using the
``--dump`` option:

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create --dump --filename [filename] [directory]

This will create a JSON file with information about your formatted
files.

Viewing information
-------------------

To view information about your dataset, you can use the ``view``
command. There are two options for viewing information:

1. **View a list of artists:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view --data [datafile] artists --names

This will display a list of all artists in the dataset.

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view --data [datafile] artists --tracks

This will display a list of all artists in the dataset along with their
tracks.

2. **View a list of songs:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view --data [datafile] songs --artist [artist name]

This will display a list of all songs by the specified artist.

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view --data [datafile] songs --id [youtube ID]

This will display a list of all songs with the specified youtube ID.

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view --data [datafile] songs --name [track name]

This will display a list of all songs with the specified track name.
