If you're tired of your audio files being a complete mess with poorly
formatted names and missing metadata this might be your solution.

Using audiodotturn you can quickly and easily organize your entire audio
library with just a few commands.

The project initially began due to a dumb mistake by myself where I
downloaded over 3000+ songs with yt-dlp with no proper formatting or
metadata included.

Installation
============

.. code:: sh

	 pip install audiodotturn

Or install from source with

.. code:: sh

	 git clone https://github.com/tairenfd/audiodotturn.git
	 cd audiodotturn
	 pip install .

Set User Config
===============

Depending on how your system and python PATHs are set the installation path may differ.
Usually however, you should be able to find the default config.json in one of the below

 .. code:: sh

    /home/user/.local/lib/python{3}.{11}/site-packages/audiodotturn/config/config.json
    /usr/local/lib/python{x}.{x}/site-packages/audiodotturn/config/config.json
    /usr/lib/python{x}.{x}/site-packages/audiodotturn/config/config.json

Once the default config is found, copy it to one of the below paths with `cp <DEFAULT_CONFIG> <NEW_PATH>`

.. code:: sh

    ~/.config/audiodotturn/
    ~/config/audiodotturn/
    ~/audiodotturn/
    ~/
    /usr/local/etc/audiodotturn/
    /etc/audiodotturn/

Once copied rename the config file to adt_config.json and change any desired settings, if the config warning is no longer showing up,
then your new config has loaded properly.

Dependencies
============

External libraries: 

	- `rich <https://github.com/Textualize/rich>`__

	- os 
	- re 
	- json 
	- argparse 
	- shutil

Usage
=====

AudioDotTurn has two main commands for interacting with the music library: ``create`` and ``view``.

The ``create`` command allows you to format and/or organize your files,
while the ``view`` command allows you to view information about your
existing data.

There is however a third positional argument, ``set``.

The ``set`` command can also be used to set default values. It will have
you confirm or deny any changes to ensure safety. Multiple values can be
changed at once.

Flags and positional arguments

             -N NAME           View list of songs by name

Choosing a formatter
--------------------

The default formatter is now the ``standard`` formatter which applies no
youtube_id data attribute but otherwise works the same. It will still
read formatted files with a youtube_id fine when creating a json, but
will not create new datasets with youtube_id's - instead putting that
info if provided into the ``misc`` category. This is the recommended
formatter for general use.

The ``youtube`` formatter is primarily for files downloaded with yt-dlp
that still contain a suffix of [youtube_id].ext

You can set a default formatter in the config.json file, or set it
during runtime with ``-x [formatter]``

To view the currently set default formatter use
``audiodotturn --defaults settings`` 

- default formatter listed under ``program defaults -> formatter``

You can view the available formatters with
``audiodotturn --defaults options`` 

- options will be under ``program options -> formatter``

Creating a dataset
------------------

To create a dataset, you first need to format your filenames. There are
three options for formatting filenames:

1. **Format a single file:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create -f [filename]

This will format the filename using the default format.

If your file doesn't follow this format, the tool will attempt to format
it as best it can. You can also specify a custom format using the
``--format`` option.

2. **Format all files in a directory:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create -F [directory]

This will format all files in the specified directory using the default
format.

3. **Organize files into artist directories:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create -d [directory]

This will organize all files in the specified directory into artist
directories based on the artist names in the filenames.

After formatting your filenames, you can create a dataset using the
``--dump`` option:

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn create -D --filename [filename] --directory [directory]

This will create a JSON file with information about your formatted
files. If directory is not set then config directory path will be used,
default is set to current working directory.

Viewing information
-------------------

To view information about your dataset, you can use the ``view``
command. There are two options for viewing information:

1. **View a list of artists:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view -d [datafile] artists -n

This will display a list of all artists in the dataset.

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view -d [datafile] artists -t

This will display a list of all artists in the dataset along with their
tracks.

2. **View a list of songs:**

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view -d [datafile] songs -a [artist name]

This will display a list of all songs by the specified artist.

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view -d [datafile] songs -i [youtube ID]

This will display a list of all songs with the specified youtube ID.

.. code:: sh

         audiodotturn view -d [datafile] songs -N [track name]

This will display a list of all songs with the specified track name.

Roadmap
=======

-  Allow to confirm/deny filename changes, currently adding ``--dry`` before any ``set`` or ``create`` functions is recommended.
-  General regex adjusting for broader use
-  Refactoring code for better readability and maintainability
-  Bug fixes and optimization
